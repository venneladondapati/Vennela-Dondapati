Olympic Data Analysis using Pymongo.
One of the most popular NoSQL databases is MongoDB. 
MongoDB uses JSON-like documents that can have varied structures. It uses the MongoDB query language to allow access to the stored data. Since it is schema-free, you can create documents without having to create the structure for the document first.
When a query is made to mongodb,Indexes are preferred for searching the documents within the collection. But if an index is missing, every document within the collection must be searched to select the documents that were requested in the query.
So I have to decided to work with MongoDB using Pymongo.
Priory,I have installed mongodb on my system locally and then made connection to it using port 27017.
Once the connection is made,I have created database and pushed data into it.
Using pymongo I made lot of analysis and saw different results.
I have attached the code for Analysis as well as code for preprocessing data.
I have given a clear documnetation about step by step process involved in my implementation.
Have a look into it!
